### What I learned

In this Challenge we were given a webpage in which we had to make it more accessible,
and more optimized for search engines. While going into this challenge I felt I had no 
idea what any of that meant, and can confidentally say that I still probably don't, I 
can say that I feel more confident about my repo's and how to properly deploy and work 
with my machine. Overall this was an interesting challenge that taught me a lot about what
is most likely to happen on a day to day job.
