Challenge-1
## Description:
In this Challenge we were given a webpage in which wwe had to make it more accessbile,
and more optimized for search engines. While going into this challenge I felt I had no 
idea what any of that meant, and can confidentally say that I still probably don't, I 
can say that I feel more confident about my repo's and how to properly deploy and work 
with my machine. Overall this was an interesting challenge that taught me a lot about what
is most likely to happen on a day to day job. 

### Languages and Tools I used
- HTML
- CSS 
- And lots of googling and youtube
